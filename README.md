This is the implementation of paper titled "**Unlocking Low Frequency Syscalls in Kernel Fuzzing with Dependency-Based RAG**". For more details about SyzGPT, please refer to [our paper](https://zhiyu.netlify.app/files/issta25main_syzgpt.pdf) from ISSTA'25. We also provide a [README_for_review](./docs/README_for_review.md), which was once located in an [anonymous repository](https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SyzGPT-eval) for better understanding by reviewers.

**Quick Glance**: SyzGPT is an LLM-assisted kernel fuzzing framework for automatically generating effective seeds for low frequency syscalls (LFS). Linux kernel provides over [360 system calls](./data/builtin_syscalls.txt) and Syzkaller defines more than [4400 specialized calls](./data/builtin_variants.txt) encapsulated for specific purposes of system calls. However, many of these syscalls (called [LFS](./docs/LFS.md)) are hard to be consistently covered due to the complex dependencies and mutation uncertainty, leaving the testing space. SyzGPT can automatically extract and augment syscall dependencies for these LFS and generate effective seeds with dependency-based RAG (DRAG). Our evaluation shows that SyzGPT can improve overall code coverage and syscall coverage, and find LFS-induced vulnerabilities. We also release a toy model [ü§óCodeLlama-syz-toy](https://huggingface.co/zzra1n/CodeLlama-syz-toy) specialized for Syz-program.

We also generate a [wiki page](https://deepwiki.com/QGrain/SyzGPT) for SyzGPT through [DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/).

### 1.2 Setup with Docker (Recommend) [‚è∞~10min]

We have released two docker images: `qgrain/syzgpt:pretest`(early access version) and `qgrain/syzgpt:full` (with full functionality and evaluation benchmark). **To understand how we build these docker images, please refer to this repo**: [QGrain/kernel-fuzz-docker-images](https://github.com/QGrain/kernel-fuzz-docker-images).

<details>
<summary>Setup with qgrain/syzgpt:pretest</summary>

To facilitate the researchers who want to test our work ASAP, we release the `qgrain/syzgpt:pretest` as an early-bird image, which includes a runnable SyzGPT-generator and SyzGPT-fuzzer (experimental configurations and code are not included).

1. Create the container:

```bash
docker run -itd --name syzgpt_pretest --privileged=true qgrain/syzgpt:pretest
# You will find SyzGPT located at /root/SyzGPT and SyzGPT-fuzzer at /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer
```

2. Synchronize SyzGPT repository (please always):

```bash
cd /root/SyzGPT && git pull
```

3. Minor steps:

```bash
cd /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer && make -j32
# You need to build the fuzzer as we did not include the binaries into image to save size.

workon syzgpt
# Enter the python virtual environment with the dependencies required by SyzGPT-generator
```

</details>

<details open>
<summary>Setup with qgrain/syzgpt:full</summary>

If you only want to directly use SyzGPT for fuzzing, you can choose the smaller one `syzgpt:pretest`.

```bash
docker run -itd --name syzgpt_full --privileged=true qgrain/syzgpt:full
# You will find everything is OK as expected, including the functionalities and experiments of SyzGPT.

cd /root/SyzGPT && git pull
# Please always synchronize SyzGPT repository first.
```
</details open>

### 1.3 Setup from Scratch [‚è∞~20min]

<details>
<summary>Click to view</summary>

You can also setup SyzGPT from scratch on a Ubuntu 20.04/22.04. Or base on our image [`qgrain/kernel-fuzz:v1`](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/qgrain/kernel-fuzz/general).

```bash
docker run -itd --name syzgpt_from_scratch --privileged=true qgrain/kernel-fuzz:v1
```

1. Clone this project:

```bash
# Recommend at /root/SyzGPT, so that the following instructions can match with the path.
# If you are a normal user on a physical machine, feel free to clone it at a convenient place.
git clone https://github.com/QGrain/SyzGPT.git
```

2. Setup **SyzGPT-generator**: Please refer to Setup section in [generator/README.md](generator/README.md)

3. Setup **SyzGPT-fuzzer**: Please refer to [fuzzer/README.md](fuzzer/README.md)

</details>

## 2 Usage

SyzGPT can serve as a **standalone seed generator** through SyzGPT-generator (**Section 2.1**). It can also cooperate with SyzGPT-fuzzer for **continuous kernel fuzzing** (**Section 2.2**).

We have released the augmented syscall depencies at [data/dependencies](data/dependencies/). So you can directly run SyzGPT without extracting syscall dependency. You can also extract the syscall dependencies on your own (**Section 2.3**).

For any questions in using SyzGPT, you may refer to [Troubleshooting](./docs/Troubleshooting.md) or feel free to raise an issue.

### 2.1 Run SyzGPT for Seed Generation [‚è∞~30min]

We provide a simplest running instruction here. For detailed usage, please refer to [generator/README.md](generator/README.md).

Prerequisites: 
- A corpus generated by at local Syzkaller or some other existing fuzzers, which can serve as the corpus knowledge base. We provide a `corpus_24h.db` at [data/corpus_24h.db](./data/corpus_24h.db) for reproduction.
- A file containing target syscalls for which you want to generate seeds. We provide a `sampled_variants.txt` at [data/sampled_variants.txt](./data/sampled_variants.txt) for reproduction.

#### Step 1: Generate seeds (NOTE: it will interact with LLM and cost tokens)

```bash
cd /root/SyzGPT && workon syzgpt

# (1) Use official OpenAI api, which will load api_key, llm_model, ... from private_config.py.
python syzgpt_generator.py -s /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer -w WORKDIR -e data/corpus_24h.db -f data/sampled_variants.txt

# (2) Use third party api
python syzgpt_generator.py -M gpt-3.5-turbo-16k -u https://api.expansion.chat/v1/ -k API_KEY -s /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer -w WORKDIR -e data/corpus_24h.db -f data/sampled_variants.txt

# (3) Use local LLMs
python syzgpt_generator.py -M CodeLlama-syz-toy -u http://IP:PORT/v1/ -s /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer -w WORKDIR -e data/corpus_24h.db -f data/sampled_variants.txt
```

<details>
<summary>Click to view: Explanation of Parameters</summary>

- `-s`: path to the SyzGPT-fuzzer, must be specified.
- `-w`: output the generated results and logs to `WORKDIR` (every task should has its own `WORKDIR`), must be specified.
- `-e`: path to external corpus, only nessary in one-time seed generation.
- `-f`: path to the file containing target syscall list, only needed in one-time seed generation.
- `-c`: you can also specify the target syscalls through `-c CALL1 CALL2 ...` manually, instead of `-f`.
- `-M`: model name, used with third party api or local LLM.
- `-u`: base_url to api address or local hosted LLM.
- `-k`: api_key for third party api service.

</details>

You will find the structure of `WORKDIR` looks like:

```bash
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ external_corpus/          # external corpus specified through -e
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generated_corpus/         # generated seeds in Syz-program format (‚òÖ)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ generation_history.json   # generation history for feedback-guided seed generation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ query_prompts/            # generation logs including query prompts and results, can be used for fine-tuning.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ reverse_index.json        # reverse index for DRAG
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ target_syscalls/          # generation targets
```

#### Step 2: Repair and purify seeds

```bash
# Repair the seeds
/root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer/bin/syz-repair WORKDIR/generated_corpus WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair

# Purify the seeds
/root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer/bin/syz-validator dir WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair_valid

# Now you can pack the seeds as corpus for fuzzing or some tasks
/root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer/bin/syz-db pack WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair_valid WORKDIR/SyzGPT_sampled_corpus.db
```

#### Step 3: Evaluate the generation

```bash
# 1. Evaluate the Syntax Valid Rate (SVR)
/root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer/bin/syz-validator dir WORKDIR/generated_corpus

# 2. Evaluate the Syntax Valid Rate (SVR) after repair
/root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer/bin/syz-validator dir WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair

# 3. Evaluate the N_avg and L_avg
/root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer/bin/syz-validator dir WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair_valid
python /root/SyzGPT/analyzer/corpus_analyzer.py analyze -d WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair_valid

# 4. Evaluate the Context Effective Rate (CER)
cp -r WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair_valid WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair_valid_rev
python /root/SyzGPT/experiments/performance/reverse_prog.py WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair_valid_rev
syzqemuctl create image-eval
syzqemuctl run image-eval
syzqemuctl exec image-eval "mkdir /root/evaluate_cer"
syzqemuctl cp WORKDIR/generated_corpus_repair_valid_rev image-eval:/root/evaluate_cer/
syzqemuctl cp /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer/bin/linux_amd64/syz-execprog image-eval:/root/
syzqemuctl cp /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer/bin/linux_amd64/syz-executor image-eval:/root/
syzqemuctl exec image-eval "/root/syz-execprog -semantic -progdir /root/evaluate_cer/generated_corpus_repair_valid_rev -coverfile /root/evaluate_cer/out/CER"
syzqemuctl cp image-eval:/root/evaluate_cer/CER_Evaluation_Results ./
# It's a bit complicated, recommend to use our all-in-one script `experiments/performance/evaluate.py`
```

> [!NOTE] 
> You can run the all-in-one script to reproduce the seed generation experiments in paper Table 2.

```bash
python /root/SyzGPT/experiments/performance/evaluate.py -i /root/images -n image-eval -k /root/kernels/linux-6.6.12 -s /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer -w WORKDIR
# The evaluation results are written to WORKDIR/evaluate.log
```

### 2.2 Run SyzGPT for Fuzzing [‚è∞~24h]

We provide a simplest running instruction here. For detailed usage, please refer to [generator/README.md](generator/README.md) and [fuzzer/README.md](fuzzer/README.md).

#### Step 1: Run SyzGPT-fuzzer

```bash
# cd /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer
# e.g., WORKDIR=workdir/v6-1/SyzGPT
taskset -c 8-15 ./bin/syz-manager -config cfgdir/SyzGPT.cfg -bench benchdir/SyzGPT.log -statcall -backup 24h -enrich WORKDIR/generated_corpus -period 1h -repair
```

<details>
<summary>Click to view: Explanation of Parameters</summary>

(refer to [fuzzer/README.md](fuzzer/README.md) for more details)
- `-statcall`: enable syscall tracking during fuzzing.
- `-backup`: backup **rawcover**, **corpus.db**, **CoveredCalls**, and **crahes** every 24h.
- `-enrich`: load the enriched seeds from `WORKDIR/generated_corpus` every `INTERNAL` (1h).
- `-period`: `INTERVAL` of loading enriched seeds.
- `-repair`: enable program repair which is implemented in SyzGPT-fuzzer.

</details>

#### Step 2: Run SyzGPT-generator (NOTE: it will cost tokens)

```bash
# cd the root of this project
python syzgpt_generator.py -s /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer -w /root/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer/workdir/v6-1/SyzGPT/generated_corpus -D 1h -T 1h -S 24h -m 100 -P 10
# seemingly, you can also use other api service
# or local hosted LLM with -M, -u, -k (introduced in section 2.1)
```

<details>
<summary>Click to view: Explanation of Parameters</summary>

(refer to [generator/README.md](generator/README.md) for more details)
- `-s` and `-w` have been introduced above.
- `-D`: an empirical delay (1h) before generator start to work, which leave the fuzzer to explore by default.
- `-T`: generate seeds every `INTERVAL` (1h), need to be in the same pace with `-enrich` in fuzzer.
- `-S`: stop generating after 24h.
- `-m`: max generation amount, 100 here.
- `-P`: probability of feedback-guided re-generation for failed seeds, 10% here.

</details>

#### Step 3: Evaluate the fuzzing

- Plot the growth of metrics (**coverage**, **syscalls**, **new\ inputs**...)

```bash
# Normal Usage of plotting the curves of metrics over time:
# 1. Plot single logs of each fuzzers to compare:
python bench_parser.py -b logA logB .. -k coverage syscalls crashes 'crash types' -l fuzzerA fuzzerB ... -t 24h -p -o ../plots/ -T PLOT_TITLE
# 2. Plot average logs of each fuzzers to compare:
python bench_parser.py -b logA1 logA2 logA3 logB1 logB2 logB3 .. -a 3 -k coverage syscalls crashes 'crash types' -l fuzzerA fuzzerB ... -t 24h -p -o ../plots/ -T PLOT_TITLE
```

- Visualize the crashes

```bash
python /root/SyzGPT/scripts/result_parser.py -D /path/to/WORKDIR1/crashes /path/to/WORKDIR2/crashes ... -c
```

### 2.3 Extract Syscall Dependency

#### Step 1: Extract Specialized Call Level Dependency [‚è∞~3min]

We extract the specialized call level (syz-level) dependency through resource-based static analysis on Syzlangs.

1. Extract defined syscalls of the fuzzer (different fuzzers would have different builtin syscalls, e.g., KernelGPT):

```bash
# it will generate debug.log at ~/SyzGPT/data/debug.log and generate builtin_syscalls* at -o
cd extractor
python parse_builtin_syscalls.py -s ~/fuzzers/SyzGPT-fuzzer -o ../data/
```

2. Extract syz-level dependencies:

```bash
# it will generate syz-level dependencies at -o
python extract_syz_dependencies.py -b ../data/builtin_syscalls.json -o ../data/dependencies/syz_level/Syzkaller_deps/
```

#### Step 2: Extract System Call Level Dependency [‚è∞~45min]

1. Crawler the manpage documentation by syscalls:

```bash
# it will download the docs at crawler/man_docs/SYSCALL.json
cd crawler
python get_syscall_doc.py
```

2. Extract call-level dependencies (**NOTE: it will interact with LLM and cost tokens**):

```bash
# -d for dumb mode, recommended
cd extractor
python extract_call_dependencies.py -f ../crawler/syscall_from_manpage.txt -d
```

## 3 Fine-tuning LLM for Syz-programs [‚è∞~16h]

We have repleased a toy version of CodeLlama-syz at [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/zzra1n/CodeLlama-syz-toy). For more details, please refer to [fine-tune/README.md](fine-tune/README.md)

## 4 Reusability

**Our approach is able to be migrated to other kernel fuzzing framework**, such as Syzkaller-like (ACTOR, ECG, KernelGPT, ...) and Healer-like (Healer and MOCK) fuzzers. **Our approach can also be applied to other tasks, such as directed kernel fuzzing.**

### 4.1 Migrate to Syzkaller-like Fuzzers [‚è∞~10min]

We have demonstrated the migration on KernelGPT, please refer to the implementation instruction in [experiments/KernelGPT/README.md](experiments/KernelGPT/README.md).

### 4.2 Migrate to Healer-like Fuzzers

Simple as migrating to Syzkaller-like, as long as you are familiar with RUST.

We also prepare a instruction for migrating to MOCK, please refer to the implementation instruction in [experiments/MOCK/README.md](experiments/MOCK/README.md).

### 4.3 Migrate to Directed Kernel Fuzzing

**Our approach is also applicable in directed kernel fuzzing domain**, as long as we have the target syscalls required by the directed task. Please refer to [experiments/directed/README.md](experiments/directed/README.md).
